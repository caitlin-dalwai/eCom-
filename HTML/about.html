                                SILK was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate makeup lovers who shared a common frustration: the lack of access to high-value makeup products in their country. Recognizing the growing demand for luxury cosmetics that were not readily available locally, they set out to fill this gap in the market and bring the world of international beauty to their doorstep.
                                <br><br>
                                The journey began with extensive research and collaboration with suppliers and distributors around the globe. Leveraging their network and industry expertise, the founders meticulously curated a selection of exclusive makeup brands and products that were highly sought-after but not accessible to customers in their country. Every item in SILK's inventory was handpicked for its quality and authenticity..
                                <br><br>
                                Over the years, SILK has continued to evolve and expand its offerings, staying ahead of trends and innovations in the beauty industry. Through strategic partnerships with international brands and ongoing efforts to enhance the online shopping experience.
                                With a dedicated team of beauty enthusiasts and a growing community of satisfied customers, SILK continues to redefine the beauty landscape in South Africa, one exquisite product at a time
